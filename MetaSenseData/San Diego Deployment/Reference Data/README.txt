The reference data used for analysis was provided courtesy of the San Diego and San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control
Districts.  We removed reference data collected during calibration periods as well as any data flagged during initial quality
assurance/control by the regulatory agency who supplied the data. These data have not passed through the normal review process
and are therefore not quality-assured, and they are thus unofficial data.
